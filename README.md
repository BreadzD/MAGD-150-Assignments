# MAGD150_Assignments
Welcome to my GitHub page for my MAGD class assignments, here I will upload files so that the world can learn from my code for p5.js and use it as a reference. Hope everyone enjoys and use this for your own learning as well!

Here are some links to five of the assignments I worked on for this class:
